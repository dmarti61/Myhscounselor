      <p>
        High school graduation can feel like stepping off a cliff if you don't know where you're landing. I remember the constant pressure to "go to college," but zero real guidance on **what to study**, **why**, or if it was even the right fit. That lack of clear direction, shared by many of my friends, stuck with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real turning point was when my own siblings started facing the same post-high school unknowns. I wanted to give them more than just an opinion; I wanted a **one-stop shop** for answers. MyHSCounselor.com was born from that need â€“ a desire to transform confusing questions into interactive, actionable solutions.
