      <h1>💡 Our Story: From a Personal Framework to a Proven Solution</h1>
      <p>
        After graduating college with a communications degree, I dove into a career in public relations, only to realize it wasn't my passion. My professional path felt uncertain until I became a parent. This new perspective prompted a period of deep self-reflection, where I finally identified my core strengths and personality type. That clarity was my turning point, giving me the confidence to return to school and earn my MBA. </p>
      <p>
        When my younger brothers began asking for advice on their own paths, I didn't want them to feel as lost as I once did. I drafted a detailed email for them in 2014—a step-by-step framework to help them find a path that was the right fit. That email became the blueprint for MyHSCounselor.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to give every student the same clarity and confidence I found, so they can navigate their "next" with a plan that's proven to work.
