    <h1>✅ Making Your Decision Official: Your Next Steps After Graduation</h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations! You’ve explored your options, received offers, and are now ready to commit to your next big step after high school. This stage is exciting, but it also comes with important deadlines and details. Let’s make sure you nail the next steps, no matter which path you’ve chosen.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Understanding & Comparing Your Offers</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve applied to multiple places, you might have different offers on the table. It's time to compare your options to find the best fit.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Review the Offer Details:</strong> Whether it's a college award letter, a trade school contract, or a job offer, read every detail carefully. For colleges, this includes the financial aid package and "net price" (cost minus grants/scholarships).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider the Total Cost:</strong> For educational paths, factor in tuition, housing, fees, and living expenses. For jobs, look at the salary, benefits, and potential relocation costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Think Beyond Money:</strong> Which program or opportunity truly excites you? Where do you feel you'll thrive? What are the long-term career outcomes?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Don't Be Afraid to Ask Questions:</strong> If something in an offer is unclear, contact the admissions office, financial aid department, or HR representative directly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="emphasis">
        <strong>Wise Tip:</strong> Create a simple spreadsheet to list out the key details of each offer—costs, aid, benefits, and pros/cons. It helps visualize the differences!

      <h2>Confirming Your Commitment: Deposits & Deadlines</h2>
      <p>
        Once you’ve made your final decision, it's time to officially accept your spot. Pay close attention to the deadlines!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Acceptance Deposit/Paperwork:</strong> Most colleges and trade schools require a non-refundable deposit to secure your spot. Military branches and jobs will have specific contracts or onboarding documents to sign.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Key Dates:</strong> Note the specific deadlines to accept your offer. For colleges, this is often a "Candidate Reply Date" (typically May 1st), but you should always check your specific acceptance letter. For other paths, this will be your contract signing date or a specific onboarding deadline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notify Other Places:</strong> It's good etiquette to let other institutions or employers know you won't be accepting their offer. A simple email is usually sufficient and helps them offer the spot to someone else.
        </li>
      </ul>
