    <p className="intro">
      Thinking about what comes after high school? For some, it's straight to college, trade school, or a job. But for others, the idea of taking a "gap year" ‚Äì a purposeful break before diving into the next big thing ‚Äì can be really appealing. This isn't just a year off; it's a "year on," filled with new experiences and learning. Let's explore if it's the right path for you.

      <h2>What Exactly is a Gap Year?</h2>
      <p>
        A gap year is typically a structured period of time, usually a year (but can be shorter or longer!), taken between high school graduation and the start of college, trade school, military service, or a full-time career. It's a chance to step back from formal academics and explore personal interests, gain new skills, or simply get a clearer picture of your future goals.
      </p>
      <p className="why-it-matters">
        <strong>Wise Tip:</strong> The key word is "purposeful." A successful gap year isn't just Netflix and chilling for 12 months. It involves planning and intention!
