    <h3>üîß Pathways to a Trade Career</h3>

    <div className="trade-pathway-section">
      <h4>1. Trade Schools & Vocational Programs</h4>
      <p>
        Trade schools (also called vocational schools or technical colleges) offer focused, hands-on training for specific careers. They cut out general education classes, so you learn exactly what you need for your chosen trade.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>What you'll do:</strong> Learn essential skills through classroom instruction, lab work, and practical simulations. You'll gain certifications that prove your readiness for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Typical Timelines:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>**Short Certificates:** As little as **3 months to 1 year** for trades like cosmetology, medical assisting, culinary arts, or basic welding.</li>
            <li>**Diplomas/Associate Degrees:** Usually **1 to 2 years** for more comprehensive programs in HVAC, automotive technology, electrical technology, or plumbing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ideal for:</strong> Students who prefer structured learning, want to gain foundational knowledge quickly, and are ready to dive into specialized training.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How to start:</strong> Research local community colleges or private trade schools, check their program offerings and accreditation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div className="trade-pathway-section">
      <h4>2. Apprenticeships (Earn While You Learn!)</h4>
      <p>
        Apprenticeships are the ultimate "earn while you learn" model. You work for a company, get paid, and receive on-the-job training from experienced professionals, all while attending some related classroom instruction.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>What you'll do:</strong> Work full-time (or near full-time) on real projects, gaining practical experience daily. You'll also have a set number of classroom hours per year. Your pay typically increases as you gain skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Typical Timelines:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>**Generally:** **1 to 6 years**, depending on the complexity of the trade and state requirements. Most are **3-5 years**.</li>
            <li>**Examples:**
              <ul>
                <li>**Electrician:** Often 4-5 years</li>
                <li>**Plumber:** Often 3-5 years</li>
                <li>**HVAC Technician:** Often 3-5 years</li>
                <li>**Carpenter:** Often 3-4 years</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ideal for:</strong> Students who thrive with hands-on learning, want to avoid student debt, and are ready to commit to a longer-term training program directly out of high school.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How to start:</strong> Look for opportunities through local unions, trade associations, individual companies, or government apprenticeship programs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div className="trade-pathway-section">
      <h4>3. On-the-Job Training & Entry-Level Roles</h4>
      <p>
        Some trades or positions allow you to start with minimal formal training and learn directly on the job. These are often "helper" or "laborer" roles that can be stepping stones to more skilled positions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>What you'll do:</strong> Work alongside experienced workers, assisting them and learning the basics of the trade through direct observation and practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Typical Timelines:</strong> Varies greatly. You could be working and learning for **several months to a couple of years** before gaining enough experience to move into more specialized work or pursue a certification.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ideal for:</strong> Students who want to start working immediately and are proactive about seeking out learning opportunities from their colleagues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How to start:</strong> Look for "laborer," "helper," or "entry-level technician" job postings with construction companies, service providers (e.g., HVAC companies), or manufacturing plants.
        </li>
      </ul>
