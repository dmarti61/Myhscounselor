      <h2>Ace Your Interview!</h2>
      <p>
        The interview is your chance to shine and show off your personality and potential.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Research the Company/Job:</strong> Know what they do and what the job entails. This shows you're serious.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dress Appropriately:</strong> For most entry-level jobs, clean, neat, and slightly formal (like nice pants/skirt and a collared shirt or blouse) is a safe bet. When in doubt, overdress slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice Common Questions:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>"Tell me about yourself." (Keep it concise, relevant to the job)</li>
            <li>"Why do you want to work here?"</li>
            <li>"What are your strengths/weaknesses?" (Be honest about weaknesses but explain how you're working on them)</li>
            <li>"Tell me about a time you worked as part of a team." (Even from school projects!)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare Your Questions:</strong> Always have 1-2 questions to ask the interviewer (e.g., "What does a typical day look like in this role?" or "What are the opportunities for growth here?"). This shows engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow Up:</strong> Send a polite thank-you email within 24 hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
